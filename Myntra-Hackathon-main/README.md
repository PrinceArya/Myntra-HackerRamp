<h1 id="obj">1. Problem Statement</h1>

<strong>
  While watching a movie or a favorite web series on any of the OTT platform, don't you feel the urge that I also want clothes which are similar to the actor /actress, don't you want to look like them or don't you think that I also want to be trendy and look cool among my fellow mates? To develop an app against this that will scan and give similar images compared to the actor and actresses' clothes.

<h1 id="sol">2. Solution:</h1>

We developed an AI-based API, which can be integrated with various OTT platforms. 
It will automatically take the screenshot of the screen and give suggestions to buy similar products, based on our ML model's prediction when clicked on Find Similar button. 
So while watching a video/movie, pause it, click on the button, and we will provide you with links of similar products for shopping.

<h1 id="pre">3. Preprocessing:</h1>
We use this python script for preprocessing our data as per our needs.

import os
path = "/home/prince/Documents/Rough/"
for filename in os. listdir(path):
    print(filename)
    filename_without_ext = filename.split("_")[0]
    extension = ".jpg"
    new_file_name = filename_without_ext+extension
    os.rename(path+filename,path+new_file_name)

<h1 id="model">4. Model:</h1>

To classify the images, we used Xception model from Google and used it’s global average pooling layer(second last layer) to extract the feature vector and apply Knn to predict top-k similar feature vector in our database. (In our case we k=30).
